NAVXUI

The navXUI user interface application provides a simple way to visualize the data provided by any navX-sensor.


RECALIBRATION:

Gyroscopes are sensitive to ambient temperature, so it is imperative that you recalibrate them upon reception AND at events. NavX instructions are as follows.

Place them NavX on a still platform parallel to the earth's surface (use a level!).
Press and hold the CAL button for at least 10 seconds.
When you release the CAL button ensure that the CAL led flashes briefly.
Press the RESET button.
Wait up to 15 seconds.
yaw accuracy may be diminished until the next On-the-fly Gyro calibration completes. (which means your first autonomous may not act right!)


PREFERED COMMUNUCATION METHOD:

NavX SPI communication over the roboRIO MXP. This is the recommended method of communicating with NavX devices.
